This project is just "for fun". There are way better implementations for immutable data structures and typeclasses.

Given the differences between Scala and Haskell, this is not complete nor an exact copy of the Haskell prelude. Almost everywhere the _dot notation_ has been preferred (ie `type.function`). Moreover, in order to help the Scala type inference the order of function parameters has been changed to improve the API usage.

The library is currently implementing the following types:

* `Data.List`
* `Data.Maybe`
* `Data.Either`

and the following typeclasses:

* `Show`
* `Eq`
* `Ord`
* `Num`
* `Integral`
* `Fractional`
* `Enum`

## Layout ##

The project has the following layout:

```
+ src
--+ main
----+ scala
------+ io
---------+ hascalator
------------+ Prelude.scala   // the entry point
------------+ data            // basic data types (ie Maybe, Either, List...)
------------+ dst             // immutable, purely function data structures
------------+ math            // math types
------------+ typeclasses     // typeclasses
```
